# Chronos
> An iOS utility framework to create different types of timers.

### Description

Chronos provides a simple but powerful `Chronos.Timer` class that provides more control and flexibility than the native iOS `Foundation.Timer`. The timer object can be created from the following supported types:

- `.basic` - a generic timer that is controlled manually
- `.stopwatch` - a timer that runs indefinitely, keeping track of the elapsed time
- `.countdown` - a timer that counts down from a set amount of time at a specific interval
- `.countUp` - a timer that counts up to a set amount of time at a specific interval
- `.delay` - a timer that invokes a single completion event after a set amount of time
- `.schedule` - a timer that invokes scheduled events with a frequency pattern between a start and end period
